## What is Spark?

Spark is a lightweight CSS library that takes advantage of HTML's
 `data-`-attributes to easily apply complex styles to elements.

Spark is created to be simple to use and support as many web-browsers as
 possible for the features it supports.

## Why use Spark?

- Simple to read and write.  
- Spark is designed modularly, meaning you are able to import only the
   things you absolutely need.  
- Has out-of-the-box support for different (types of) elements.  
- Supports a wide range of web-browsers, including Internet Explorer.
